	abstract = {In March of this year, a Romanian man killed himself and his 4-year old son because of a ransomware he received after visiting adult websites. This "police impersonation" malware instructed him to pay a massive fine or else go to jail for 11 years. Ransomware isn't a new threat; however, it introduced new life with {CryptoLocker}, the very first variant to perform encryption correctly, thussignificantly inhibiting security researchers and their typical countermeasures. Due to its unique nature, {CryptoLocker} is one of the few current malware campaigns that spawned its own working group focused around remediation. As time progressed, other ransomware copycat campaigns emerged, some of which got media attention even though they were nothing but vaporware.

This talk will focus on what the threat intelligence community did in response to this threat, including the development of near-time tracking of its infrastructure and what can be learned in order to manage new threats as they emerge.},
